      <p className="story-text">Something that we can associate with christmas is good old St.Nicholas
      himself, also known as the infamous Santa Claus. We have all heard the story
    of needing to put out cookies for Santa to eat while he is delivering gifts to children
  who have been good that year after he slides down the chimney. First of all, what
superhuman can possibly eat that many cookies. Where does he get all this time? Is Santa
international? I can understand the argument that Santa might have some sort of
time stopper, but let's talk about the reindeer for a second. The reindeer not only
have to go through a black hole of time but they have to also travel to each of the
houses with Santa. I'm assuming that Santa is carrying all the presents he will be
delivering in his bag. Unless he wants to go all the way back to the North Pole,
it's a little unrealistic to make so many frequent trips when he only has one night.
He is given a little bit more time due to all the different time zones, and I think that
Santa might have a big part in the reason why there are so many different time zones
around the world, otherwise, there is no way he would be able to deliver that many presents
in one night. Another thing, when Santa is going to each house, they make it seem like
him and his reindeer are parked on top of each house. First, no one has ever seen
the reindeer, and second, there is no way that many reindeer can take flight with such
a small roof. We are talking about carrying tons of weight and having a small flightstrip
to take off, it is unrealistic, especially when they are jumping from house to house.
He might as well just walk to the different houses like a UPS worker. In conclusion,
reindeer are nice to think about, but somehow Santa is working as a solo agent, without the
reindeer. I believe he uses them as a prop because deep down Santa has some self-confidence
issues and he wants another thing in the picture to take the attention off of him.
